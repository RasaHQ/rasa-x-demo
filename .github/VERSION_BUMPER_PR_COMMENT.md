ðŸ“Œ **Final step of the version bumping**

Once this PR is merged into `master`, please tag and push a new release with

```bash
git tag 0.26.0 -m 'new minor release for compatibility with Rasa X 0.26.0'
git push origin 0.26.0
```
where `0.26.0` is the placeholder of the tag name. Please replace it with the Rasa X version that Rasa X Demo should be compatible with (e.g. the up-coming Rasa X version).
